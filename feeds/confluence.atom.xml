Atlassian recommends removing installations from the Internet immediately.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, June 2nd, 2022, &lt;a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-security-advisory-2022-06-02-1130377146.html"&gt;Atlassian released a Security Advisory&lt;/a&gt; stating that Confluence Server and Data Center editions are vulnerable to an Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution vulnerability &lt;strong&gt;that is under active exploitation&lt;/strong&gt;. At this time they have not released any specifics as to what the exact vulnerable endpoint is, or any indicators of compromise that could lead defenders to believe they have been exploited. There is currently no fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a patch has been made available, it's likely that additional attackers will inspect the differences in the application binaries between the fixed and vulnerable versions, and develop attack methods rapidly. This post will be updated as information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, Atlassian is advising customers to remove Confluence Server and Data Center from being available from the Internet, either by shutting them down, or by firewalling them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability been assigned CVE-2022-26134. Patches are not yet available from the vendor. This notice will be updated when they are published.&lt;/p&gt;

Their write-up includes IP ranges the attackers utilized, as well as some additional background information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States Cybersecurity &amp;amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added this flaw to its list of &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog"&gt;known exploited vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; with a deadline for remediation of Friday, May 3rd, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
