Atlassian recommends removing installations from the Internet immediately.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, June 2nd, 2022, &lt;a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-security-advisory-2022-06-02-1130377146.html"&gt;Atlassian released a Security Advisory&lt;/a&gt; stating that Confluence Server and Data Center editions are vulnerable to an Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution vulnerability &lt;strong&gt;that is under active exploitation&lt;/strong&gt;. At this time they have not released any specifics as to what the exact vulnerable endpoint is, or any indicators of compromise that could lead defenders to believe they have been exploited. There is currently no fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a patch has been made available, it's likely that additional attackers will inspect the differences in the application binaries between the fixed and vulnerable versions, and develop attack methods rapidly. This post will be updated as information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, Atlassian is advising customers to remove Confluence Server and Data Center from being available from the Internet, either by shutting them down, or by firewalling them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability been assigned CVE-2022-26134. Patches are not yet available from the vendor. This notice will be updated when they are published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update as of May 2nd, 10:00PM New York time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity firm Volexity has &lt;a href="https://www.volexity.com/blog/2022/06/02/zero-day-exploitation-of-atlassian-confluence/"&gt;published a blog post&lt;/a&gt; detailing how they originally found this vulnerability being used in the wild, prior to reporting it to Atlassian. Their write-up includes IP ranges the attackers utilized, as well as some additional background information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States Cybersecurity &amp;amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added this flaw to its list of &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog"&gt;known exploited vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; with a deadline for remediation of Friday, May 3rd, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this update, there is still no patch available. Confluence administrators are urged to remove public-facing installations from the Internet as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

This issue can be exploited in the default configuration, and has been assigned a bug alert severity of 'very high'.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, April 20th, 2022, &lt;a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/jira-security-advisory-2022-04-20-1115127899.html"&gt;Atlassian released a Security Advisory&lt;/a&gt; stating that Jira's web authentication framework, Jira Seraph, is vulnerable to an Authentication Bypass vulnerability. At this time they have not released any specifics as to what the exact vulnerable endpoint is, or any indicators of compromise that could lead defenders to believe they have been exploited. It's likely that attackers will inspect the differences in the application binaries between the fixed and vulnerable versions, and develop attack methods rapidly. This post will be updated as information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, Atlassian is advising customers to install updated version of Jira Core Server, Jira Software Server, and Jira Software Data Center. If updating is not possible, installing updates to affected plug-ins (found in the advisory) is suggested, followed by disabling those plug-ins if updates are not available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability been assigned CVE-2022-0540. Patches are available now from the vendor.&lt;/p&gt;

These systems are commonly Internet-facing. The flaw has been assigned a bug alert severity of 'critical', and the vendor has supplied patches.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, February 8, 2022, &lt;a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2022/02/08/sap-partners-with-onapsis-to-identify-and-patch-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities/"&gt;SAP published a notice detailing a major request smuggling flaw&lt;/a&gt; within their SAP NetWeaver, SAP Content Server, and SAP Web Dispatcher products, which SAP claims could lead to authentication bypass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publicly available documentation is scarce, but the Bug Alert team has analyzed &lt;a href="https://github.com/Onapsis/onapsis_icmad_scanner/blob/master/src/ICMAD_scanner.py"&gt;the PoC&lt;/a&gt; and SAP documentation. It appears that SAP &lt;a href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/e815bb97839a4d83be6c4fca48ee5777/7.5.21/en-US/4a47abb3e1f41cd4e10000000a421937.html"&gt;can utilize the &lt;code&gt;REMOTE_USER&lt;/code&gt; header&lt;/a&gt; (which is usually stripped from untrusted traffic) to authenticate a user through an authenticating proxy or SSO module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, publicly available information is limited at this time, but it appears likely that this request smuggling issue could be utilized to insert the &lt;code&gt;REMOTE_USER&lt;/code&gt; request header and impersonate another SAP user, including the present-by-default 'Administrator' account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability been assigned CVE-2022-22536. Patches are available now from the vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
